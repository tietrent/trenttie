Raw cotton rarely gets into international trade. The by products of cotton ginning are cottonseed and linters. Linters are used in the manufacturing of rocket propulsion or explosives as these are high in cellulose content. Cottonseed is directly crushed to yield cottonseed oil and cottonseed cake.

Sustainable bio-based surfactants are a type of surfactant that is made from renewable, plant-based materials instead of petroleum. Bio-based surfactants offer several advantages over traditional petroleum-based surfactants. They are often biodegradable, meaning that they break down into natural components over time, and they are typically derived from renewable resources such as plant oils or sugars. This makes them more sustainable and eco-friendly than traditional surfactants.
